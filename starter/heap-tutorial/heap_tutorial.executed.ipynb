    "In our running example we will consider houses with the attributes of price and area. The next cell defines a house with such attributes. You will notice that we are overloading the less than operator (see method \\_\\_lt\\_\\_). The heapq functions use this operator while comparing two houses. According to our implementation, a house A is smaller than B if A is cheaper than B. "
